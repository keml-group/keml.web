# This workflow will do a clean installation of node dependencies, cache/restore them,
  #(not anymore: build the source code and run tests across different versions of node)
# package the minified browser bundle under dist/src
# and then push it to the web-editor: commit and push to main, this will trigger the deployment to that repository's GItHubPages automatically
