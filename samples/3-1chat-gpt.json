            "Sure! I can help you find repositories on GitHub that use log4j. However, please note that as an AI language model, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to browse GitHub directly. But I can provide you with general instructions on how you can find such repositories on GitHub.\n\n1. Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com) and sign in to your GitHub account.\n2. In the search bar at the top of the page, enter the following query: `log4j filename:build.gradle language:java`.\n   - The `log4j` keyword will search for repositories that mention log4j in their code or documentation.\n   - The `filename:build.gradle` filter ensures that the search is limited to repositories with a Gradle build file, which is commonly used in Java projects.\n   - The `language:java` filter narrows down the search to repositories primarily written in the Java programming language.\n3. Hit Enter or click the \"Search\" button to perform the search.\n\nGitHub will display a list of repositories that match your search query. You can explore these repositories to find projects that use log4j. Keep in mind that the search results may include various types of repositories, such as libraries, frameworks, applications, or sample projects.\n\nPlease note that log4j has been subject to several security vulnerabilities, and it is recommended to use the latest secure version or consider alternative logging libraries if security is a concern."

Narrowing the search only to Java repositories may not provide a comprehensive list of projects that use log4j, as other programming languages like Scala and Kotlin are also popular choices for log4j integration.\n\nTo conduct a more inclusive search that encompasses repositories using log4j across multiple languages, you can modify the search query on GitHub as follows:\n\n1.

In the search bar at the top of the page, enter the following query: `log4j filename:build.gradle`.\n   - The `log4j` keyword will search for repositories that mention log4j in their code or documentation.\n   - The `filename:build.gradle` filter ensures that the search is limited to repositories with a Gradle build file, which is commonly used in projects across multiple languages.\n3. Hit Enter or click the \"Search\" button to perform the search.\n\nThis modified search query will broaden the results to include repositories using log4j in any programming language, not just Java.\n\nAdditionally, you can also modify the search query to include other logging libraries like SLF4J or Logback by using multiple keywords separated by OR operators. For example: `log4j OR slf4j OR logback filename:build.gradle`.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by the initial restriction to Java repositories, and I appreciate your feedback in highlighting the need for a more inclusive search."

            "Certainly! In addition to Gradle and Maven, which are widely used build tools in the Java ecosystem, there are several other build tools that you might consider exploring:\n\n1. Ant: Ant is a popular build tool in the Java world known for its flexibility and extensibility. It uses XML-based build scripts (build.xml) to define build tasks and dependencies.\n\n2. Apache Ivy: Ivy is a dependency manager that works in conjunction with Apache Ant. It can resolve dependencies and manage the build process similar to Gradle and Maven.\n\n3. Bazel: Bazel is an open-source build tool developed by Google. It is designed to handle large-scale, multi-language projects and focuses on build performance and scalability.\n\n4. Buck: Buck is a build system developed by Facebook. It is optimized for fast incremental builds and is commonly used for Android development.\n\n5. SBT: SBT (Simple Build Tool) is a popular build tool in the Scala ecosystem. It combines build definition and dependency management and is highly integrated with the Scala programming language.\n\n6. Leiningen: Leiningen is a build tool for Clojure projects. It provides a declarative approach to build configuration and dependency management.\n\n7. CMake: CMake is a cross-platform build system used for C, C++, and other programming languages. It offers a high degree of flexibility and supports various build configurations.\n\nThese are just a few examples of build tools used in different programming ecosystems. The choice of build tool depends on your specific requirements, preferences, and the programming language or framework you are working with."

            "Log4j is primarily associated with Java and the JVM ecosystem, so its direct usage with CMake is less common. CMake is primarily used for building C, C++, and other programming language projects, whereas log4j is typically used for logging in Java applications.\n\nHowever, if you're working on a project that involves integrating Java components or libraries that use log4j with a CMake-based build system, it is possible to find usage of log4j indirectly. For example, if you have a C++ project that includes Java components built using CMake and those Java components use log4j for logging, you may find references to log4j in the CMake build scripts or configuration files related to the Java components.\n\nIn such cases, you could potentially search for repositories using log4j and CMake in combination by modifying the GitHub search query. For instance, you can try searching for repositories with log4j references alongside CMake files by using a query like: `log4j filename:CMakeLists.txt`.\n\nWhile log4j usage with CMake is less common, it's not entirely unheard of in certain scenarios where Java components are integrated into CMake-based projects."

            "I apologize for the confusion. It appears that the search query syntax used in the GitHub URL is not working as intended. GitHub's search syntax may have specific restrictions or limitations on how complex queries can be constructed.\n\nTo address this issue, I suggest using the GitHub web interface directly to perform the search with the modified query. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com) and sign in to your GitHub account.\n2. In the search bar at the top of the page, enter the following query: `log4j (filename:build.gradle OR filename:pom.xml OR filename:build.xml OR filename:BUILD OR filename:BUCK OR filename:build.sbt OR filename:project.clj OR filename:CMakeLists.txt) -2.3.2 -2.12.4`.\n3. Press Enter or click the \"Search\" button to perform the search.\n\nThis method will execute the search using GitHub's search interface, which should provide the expected results by filtering out the excluded versions.\n\nAgain, please note that the results will depend on the availability of relevant repositories on GitHub and the accuracy of the search query. It's always a good practice to review the code and repository quality before using or contributing to any open-source project, especially when dealing with security-related concerns."

According to the GitHub documentation, the search query length limit is 256 characters.\n\nIn your case, the search query I provided might have exceeded this limit due to the inclusion of multiple filenames and excluded versions. This could explain why the search query didn't produce the expected results when used as a URL.\n\nTo work around this limitation, you can try splitting the search query into multiple smaller queries. For example, you can create separate queries for each filename and then combine the results manually. This way, you can ensure that each individual query falls within the allowed character limit.\n\nAlternatively, you can perform the search directly on the GitHub website using the GitHub search interface, as it allows for longer search queries compared to the URL-based approach.\n\nI apologize for the confusion caused by this limitation, and I appreciate your understanding."
